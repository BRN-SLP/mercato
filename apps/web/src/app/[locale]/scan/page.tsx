/**
 * Submit-a-price page.
 *
 * Lives at `/scan` for backwards compatibility with existing bookmark
 * links from earlier versions of the project. The route name will be
 * aliased to `/submit` in a follow-up middleware pass; the user-facing
 * label in the navbar already says "Submit" since the foundation PR.
 *
 * The legacy camera-based BarcodeScanner is dropped, Mercato uses a
 * canonical product dropdown instead. The scanner component is kept
 * in `components/scanner/` for now in case we want to re-introduce
 * barcode-aided product selection later, but the submit flow no
 * longer depends on it.
 *
 * The page also hosts the network's recent submissions feed below
 * the form so contributors land on a live signal of "people are
 * actually submitting right now", which the marketing landing no
 * longer needs to carry.
